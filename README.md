## Testing It Out
Use `Homebrew` to install the `SDL2` dependency, and then run `DemoSDL2`:

```bash
# Install Deps
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image

# Pull Repo
$ git clone git@github.com:KevinVitale/SwiftSDL.git

# Run DemoSDL2
$ cd SwiftSDL2
$ make && make run
```

## Overview

The ‚ô•Ô∏è of making `SwiftSDL2` simple to use is `SDLPointer<SDLType>`.  

A common reaction for wrapper library authors is to expose APIs which explicitly call into every potential underlying API. [This has the benefit of feeling _"native"_](https://github.com/PureSwift/SDL/blob/master/Sources/SDL/Window.swift); however, it is ultimately very slow, error-prone, and scales extremely poorly.

To solve this, `SDLPointer<SDLType>` creates a genericized interface to wrap the `OpaquePointer` instances returned by the `SDL2` when bridged to _Swift_. Being a `SDLType` adopter means describing the pointer's intent as an object (`SDLWindow`, `SDLRenderer`, `SDLTexture`, etc...), and implementing a function which invokes the corresponding `SDL2` API associated with freeing its memory.

As an example, here is how `SDLWindow` adopts `SDLType`:

```swift
public struct SDLWindow: SDLType {
    public static func destroy(pointer: OpaquePointer) {
        SDL_DestroyWindow(pointer)
    }
}
```

Lastly, typealiases for `SDLPointer<SDLType>` make interfaces more readable (e.g., `Window`, `Renderer`, `Texture`, etc...).  

### Methodology of `SDLPointer<SDLType>`
`SDLPointer<SDLType>` has just two functions:
  - `result(of:)` is used for `SDL2` functions which return errors; and,
  - `pass(to:)` is used for `SDL2` functions that don't error-out.
  
Because these are member functions, you're able to call them on `Optional` instances of `SDLPointer<SDLType>`, foregoing the need to constantly be checking for `nil`.
  
#### `result(of:)`
This function does a great job of squashing multiple concerns into a single function call.  

```swift
let renderer: Renderer? = /* provided elsewhere */
renderer?.result(of: SDL_SetRenderDrawColor, 255, 255, 255, 255) // 1. Set bg-color
renderer?.result(of: SDL_RendererClear)                          // 2. clear render target
renderer?.pass(to: SDL_RendererPresent)                          // 3. send rendering calls to GPU
```

You have total freedom for deciding when it is necessary for your application to handle potential errors, and in the case of `result(of:)`, you may decide to ignore the `Result` being returned, or call `try...get()` if you're interested in handling potential errors.

#### `pass(to:)`
Let's say you wanted to use `IMG_LoadTexture` to create a new texture object. Here is the interface for this function:
```swift
func IMG_LoadTexture(_ renderer: OpaquePointer!, _ file: UnsafePointer<Int8>!) -> OpaquePointer!
```

We need to pass an `OpaquePointer!` as the first argument, and a file path to the second argument. Let's look at how `pass(to:)` is used to help us with this, by taking an array of texture file names and mapping them into a `Texture` instance:

```swift
let renderer: Renderer? = /* provided elsewhere */
let resourceURL = Bundle.main.resourceURL!
let textures = ["texture_1.png", "texture_2.png", "texture_3.png"]       // 1. Names of files
            .compactMap { resourceURL.appendingPathComponent($0) }       // 2. Created as full file paths
            .compactMap { renderer?.pass(to: IMG_LoadTexture, $0.path) } // 3. Pass 'OpaquePointer' to IMG_LoadTexture
            .map(Texture.init)                                           // 4. Get returned 'OpaquePointer', send to '.init'
```

In just a few lines of code, we've called `IMG_LoadTexture` using a potentially `nil` `Renderer` object; and created new `Texture` instances for just those file names which returned valid pointers from `IMG_LoadTexture`.   

### Why this matters?

None of examples involved an explicit implementations within `SwiftSDL2` in order for them to work. Nor do they require `SwiftSDL2` to coordinate API calls involving the bespoke types it introduces (`Renderer`, `Texture`, etc.). Finally, role `Renderer` takes when creating `Texture` remains solely within the underlying `SDL2` (and `SDL2_image`) libraries which are already very welld defined.

## More Examples
Let's see more of `SDLPointer<SDLType>` in action! üéâ

### Get the renderer's logical size

For example, to read the `width` and `height` of a renderer's logical size:
```swift
// Get logical renderer size ---------------------------------------------------
do {
    var width: Int32 = .zero, height: Int32 = .zero
    try renderer?.result(of: SDL_GetRendererOutputSize, &width, &height).get()
    print("\(width) x \(height)")
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```

### Create Window Example
This example is an excerpt from `CreateWindowDemo`:

```swift
try SDL.Init(subSystems: .video)

// Print available renderers ---------------------------------------------------
Renderer.availableRenderers().forEach {
print($0)
}
SDL.Hint.set("software", for: .renderDriver)

// Create window ---------------------------------------------------------------
let window = try Window(width: 640, height: 480, flags: .allowHighDPI)

// Create renderer -------------------------------------------------------------
let renderer = window
    .pass(to: SDL_CreateRenderer, -1, 0)
    .map(Renderer.init)

// Set background color --------------------------------------------------------
renderer?.result(of: SDL_SetRenderDrawColor, 255, 255, 255, 255) // Set bg-color

// Print renderer info ---------------------------------------------------------
if let renderer = renderer {
    print(try renderer.info())
}

// Get logical renderer size ---------------------------------------------------
var width: Int32 = .zero, height: Int32 = .zero
let rendererSize = renderer?.pass(to: SDL_GetRendererOutputSize, &width, &height)
print("\(width) x \(height)")
