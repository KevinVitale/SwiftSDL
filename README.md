# SwiftSDL

[Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://libsdl.org) is a cross-platform development library designed 
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware.

This project provides a lightweight wrapper around _SDL_ which makes its C-based API easy and
intiutive to use from _Swift_.

## Testing It Out
Use `Homebrew` to install the `SDL2` dependency, and then run `DemoSDL2`:

```bash
# Install Deps
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image

# Pull Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/KevinVitale/SwiftSDL.git

# Run DemoSDL2
$ cd SwiftSDL
$ make && make run
```

## Quick Start
Using `SDL.Run { engine in /*...*/ }` gets you a game loop quickly:

```swift
import Foundation
import CSDL2
import SwiftSDL2

try SDL.Run { engine in
    // Start engine ------------------------------------------------------------
    try engine.start(subsystems: .video)
    
    // Create renderer ---------------------------------------------------------
    let (window, renderer) = try engine.addWindow(width: 640, height: 480)
    
    // Handle input ------------------------------------------------------------
    engine.handleInput = { [weak engine] in
        var event = SDL_Event()
        while(SDL_PollEvent(&event) != 0) {
            if event.type == SDL_QUIT.rawValue {
                engine?.removeWindow(window)
                engine?.stop()
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Render ------------------------------------------------------------------
    engine.render = {
        renderer.result(of: SDL_SetRenderDrawColor, 255, 0, 0, 255)
        renderer.result(of: SDL_RenderClear)
        
        /* Draw your stuff */
        
        renderer.pass(to: SDL_RenderPresent)
    } 
}
```

## Overview
SDL objects are subclasses of `SDLPointer<SDLType>`. These include (but are not limited to):
  - `SDLWindow`
  - `SDLRenderer`
  - `SDLTexture`
  - `SDLSurface`

`SDLType` is a protocol which describes how the underlying SDL object is freed. Here is an example of `SDLWindow`:

```swift
public final class SDLWindow: SDLPointer<SDLWindow>, SDLType {
    public static func destroy(pointer: OpaquePointer) {
        SDL_DestroyWindow(pointer)
    }
}
```

### Methodology of `SDLPointer<SDLType>`
`SDLPointer<SDLType>` has just two functions:
  - `result(of:)` is used for `SDL2` functions which return errors; and,
  - `pass(to:)` is used for `SDL2` functions that don't error-out.
  
You're able to call them on `Optional` instances of `SDLPointer<SDLType>`, foregoing the need to constantly be checking for `nil`.
  
#### `result(of:)`
Some SDL function calls can return error codes. In these cases, use `result(of:)`. For example, when setting the renderer's draw color:

```swift
// Create renderer ---------------------------------------------------------
let (window, renderer) = try engine.addWindow(width: 640, height: 480)

// Render ------------------------------------------------------------------
engine.render = {
    do {
        try renderer.result(of: SDL_SetRenderDrawColor, 255, 255, 255, 255).get()
        try renderer.result(of: SDL_RenderClear).get()

        /* Draw your stuff */

        renderer.pass(to: SDL_RenderPresent)        
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
} 
```

##### When should I handle SDL errors?
You have total freedom for deciding when it is necessary for your application to handle potential errors; `result(of:)` has a `Void` as its `Success` type. You may decide to ignore the `Result` being returned, or call `try...get()` if you're interested in handling potential errors.

#### `pass(to:)`
Let's say you wanted to use `IMG_LoadTexture` to create a new texture object. Here is the interface for this function:

```swift
func IMG_LoadTexture(_ renderer: OpaquePointer!, _ file: UnsafePointer<Int8>!) -> OpaquePointer!
```

Like nearly all SDL functions which get exposed to Swift, we need to pass an `OpaquePointer!` as the first argument. Following that, a C-string'd `file` path is needed as the second argument. 

Let's look at how `pass(to:)` is used to help us with this when loading a texture from a file:

```swift
let texturePathURL = Bundle.main.resourceURL!.appendingPathComponent("block.png")
let texture = renderer
    .pass(to: IMG_LoadTexture, texturePathURL.path)
    .map(SDLTexture.init)
```

In just a few lines of code, we've called `IMG_LoadTexture` and created new `SDLTexture` instance from the pointer returned by `IMG_LoadTexture`.   

## More Examples
Let's see more of `SDLPointer<SDLType>` in action! ðŸŽ‰

### Get the renderer's output size

For example, to read the `width` and `height` of a renderer's output size:
```swift
let renderer: SDLRenderer? = /* returned elsewhere */
// Get logical renderer size ---------------------------------------------------
do {
    var width: Int32 = .zero, height: Int32 = .zero
    try renderer?.result(of: SDL_GetRendererOutputSize, &width, &height).get()
    print("\(width) x \(height)")
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```
